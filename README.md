# Personal CV / Portfolio (static scaffold)

This is a minimal static scaffold for a clean, modern CV page.

Files added:
- `index.html` — single-page layout with Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact
- `styles.css` — theme and responsive styles (dark-blue / white)
- `scripts.js` — small helpers (menu toggle + year)
- `./_Lamyae_Maalouf_CV.pdf` — your résumé (already present in the workspace)
- `assets/` — add `headshot.jpg` here for your photo and any project images

Preview locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from the repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Quick edits to personalize:
- Replace `Your Name` and `Your Title` in `index.html`.
- Replace the bio in the About section.
- Add `assets/headshot.jpg` and project screenshots.
- Update the contact email and social links.

Want me to customize the content using your résumé? I can extract text from `_Lamyae_Maalouf_CV.pdf` and draft the About, Experience, and Projects sections.
