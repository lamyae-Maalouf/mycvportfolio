# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions (workspace-level)

Purpose: quickly orient an AI coding agent to be productive in this repository.

High-level approach
- Start by locating the project's entry points and manifest files using these globs: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, and any files under `src/`, `cmd/`, `services/`, or `packages/`.
- If the repo is empty or missing manifests, ask the human for the intended language/tooling before making significant changes.

Discovery checklist (run in order)
- Search for agent docs and CI: `**/.github/*`, `**/README.md`, `**/AGENT.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`, `**/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Identify language and package manager by looking for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.
- Find build/test commands: `Makefile` targets, `scripts` in `package.json`, `tox.ini`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and `Dockerfile` `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`.
- Find the main source directories (`src/`, `lib/`, `cmd/`, `app/`, `services/`) and any infra/terraform directories.

Merging guidance (if a pre-existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is present)
- Preserve any human-written sections verbatim when possible. If you add automated content, wrap it with markers:
  - `<!-- copilot-instructions:autogenerated:start -->` and `<!-- copilot-instructions:autogenerated:end -->` so future runs can safely update autogenerated parts.
- If you encounter conflicts between an existing guide and discovered repository structure, prefer examples that match the actual files (manifests, CI, entrypoints).

What to document (concise, actionable bullets)
- Big picture: list the service boundaries and where each major component lives (e.g., `services/auth` = auth microservice; `web/` = frontend React app).
- Build & test: exact commands used to build, run, and test locally (include PowerShell examples for this Windows workspace). Example:
  - `npm install` then `npm run build` and `npm test`
  - `python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt; pytest`
- Debugging: how to run the app in dev mode and attach a debugger (VS Code `launch.json` note or `dotnet watch` / `npm run dev`).
- CI: where workflows live (`.github/workflows/*.yml`) and any nonstandard CI steps (docker build contexts, matrix jobs).
- Conventions: note any repo-specific patterns discovered (monorepo layout, internal tooling scripts, codegen steps).

Safety and change rules for AI agents
- Do not commit or push changes that modify more than 5 files in a single automated edit without explicit human approval.
- If tests exist, run the relevant test subset for the changed area locally before editing multiple files. If you cannot run tests, add a clear note that changes were unverified.
- Prefer minimal, focused patches. Explain assumptions at the top of the PR description.

Examples of useful file references an agent should add to this doc after discovery
- `package.json` — top-level `scripts` show `build`, `test`, and `start` commands.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — reproduces CI steps locally when possible.
- `README.md` — project overview and local setup examples.

If you are the human maintainer
- Please update this file with project-specific instructions and examples once the repository is populated.

Questions for the human (if the workspace is empty)
- What language(s) and runtime(s) should I assume for initial scaffolding?
- Are there any non-public registries, secrets, or special setup steps (VPN, corp credentials)?
